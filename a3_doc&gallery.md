I elected to utilize a different matrix mathematics library for JavaScript (NOT three.js) that
offered the same functionality that the textbook's libraries contained, but in a way that was easier
and more consistent to utilize.

Most of the files I used to write this assignment (and those I wrote for it) are contained
in the `./app` module directory. Inside is the glMatrix source files (I only took the modules) for 
the vectors and matrices) and my project source files (in `./app/src/`) which I've used.

I took some functionality from `webgl-utils.js` and `cuon-utils.js` and created my own utility for
creating the WebGL context in `./app/src/util.mjs`.

At the end of this document I've left citations for any algorithms/sources that were not derived from
the provided libraries for the course.
